### something that you've done recently that you're particularly proud of

It's not a specific project or anything, but recently I've been frustrated with my parents because they always try to contact me. I've been trying to not be shitty to them, of course because they're my parents and everything, but it can be kinda hard to deal with. Recently though I've been actively trying to understand their perspectives more and stay in contact, because I know they worry about me. Instead of trying to push them away, I've realized that, hey, even if they're trying to contact me in excess, I should go along with it because that's how they are and I should be accepting of their needs. Even with this mindset, it's still frustrating when they're always trying to contact me, but it's something I can't change and shouldn't even necessarily try to change. I've realized I can accept it and try to help them with. 


### something interesting that others might not know

As a sort of summary of what I want to do, as a main goal or philosophical goal, is to try and understand how people work. It's part of the reason why I do econ, but obviously you can't understand how people work just through econ. I like talking to people and figuring things out about people, and I'm doing my best just to understand what drives certain people. I realize it's a close to impossible goal to achieve, but it's something I've been interested in for most of my academic career.


### on a fun childhood story
I've got a fun high school story, I think I might've told it to some people here, but yeah it's probably my most embarrassing story, or at least pretty close. I was getting ready for a track meet during freshmen year, and you never want to have to shit during a race, so I went and did my business, and wiped (this is important). Apparently, I left some toilet paper sticking out of my shorts, so during the race I had this toilet paper sticking out. Someone pointed it out and I was like, oh shit.
